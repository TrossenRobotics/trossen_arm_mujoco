# WXAI Base and WXAI Follower Description (MJCF)

## Overview

This package contains robot descriptions (MJCF) of the WXAI arms by [Trossen Robotics](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/). It is derived from the [URDF description](https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm_description).

- **wxai_base.xml** - Base WXAI arm without camera mount
- **wxai_follower.xml** - WXAI arm with D405 camera mount and camera

## URDF → MJCF Derivation Steps

1. Converted URDF to MuJoCo XML.
2. Added base_link as a proper body element with inertial properties.
3. Added default classes for visual and collision geoms.
4. Added simplified collision geometries using primitive shapes.
5. Added camera_color_frame site and camera matching the URDF's camera frame position.
6. Added equality constraint for gripper mimic joint.
7. Todo: Added position-controlled actuators with tuned PD gains (kp/kv) and force limits for all 6 joints + gripper.
8. Todo: Added Texture to match with real world
